{- 
We can think of classes as collections of types that will support operations of the class

The basic type classes are the following:

Eq - equality types
Show - Showable types
Num - Numeric types
Fractional - fractional types (double & float)
Ord - ordered types
Read - Readable types
Integral - Integral types
Enum - enumeration types (like a suit on a deck of cards would be)
